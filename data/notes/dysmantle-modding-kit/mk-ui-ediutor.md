The UI editor is built in to all 10tons games.

After Developer Mode is enabled, you can enter UI editor by pressing CONTROL-e. Pressing CONTROL-e exits the mode.

Pressing CONTROL-t trims the screen size to the white rectangle size.

Pressing CONTROL-r toggles the resize mode. When enabled, you can resize the white borders.

Click to select an UI component. Drag it around holding down CONTROL. Right click to show component properties.

Pressing 's' in edit mode saves the UI. Note that if .pak versions of folders are used, it will save the file in regular folder structure, but in case the same file is found in the .pak, it will use that instead of your external file as .pak files have search priority.

Holding down F1 will show some more keys and instructions.
