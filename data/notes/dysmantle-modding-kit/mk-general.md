## How to enable developer mode

Copy the file developer.xml to the same folder where the game prog.xml file is to unlock developer mode. Restart the game.

You may notice more buttons appearing in the UI.

BACK UP YOUR SAVES BEFORE USING THESE TOOLS IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE "NORMAL" GAMEPLAY.

It's very easy to mess up saves by accident when working in developer mode. For example when pressing CONTROL+a, autotesting mode is enabled and the AI player starts playing the game. When the mode is enabled, your game state is altered permanently and marked as test save which affects all sorts of things.
