		<!--
			Note:
			Unfortunately, a maximum of only 14 weapons are possible. So we have to replace a weapon to use the Laser Shotgun.
			Plasma Shotghn technically counts as available, which stops it softlocking save files, but the UI doesn't extend far enough to view it.
			The high medal requirement prevents the Plasma Shotgun's unlock notification from triggering, if the player hasn't unlocked it yet

		NOTES:
			Customise properties in abilities.xml

			ANTIOCH_GRENADES    - AMAZING! Huge area of effect, high damage. (description translates to: "Merciful Jesus, grant them rest")
			CLUSTER_GRENADES    - Fires 5 grenades in a line in front of you. They explode and cause fire
			DASH                - Fun, but very hard to use. You dash forward way too quickly
			DEFENSIVE_GRENADES  - Functionally identical to shrapnel grenades
			EMP_PULSE           - Useless, no effect
			LASER_PULSE         - Fires lots of lasers outward, which bounce off walls. Low damage but has potential if
			                      buffed, or unlocked early
			RAIL_PULSE          - aka Piercing Pulse. Fires piercing lead shots outward, like LASER_PULSE. Looks cool but
			                      needs a big buff,, as it atm it has weak damage with low accuracy.
