# JYDGE Enhanced (Mod)

A huge mod for the game JYDGE, by 10tons.

@todo: Check the Recalibrated mod, and remove any duplicate entries from the notes below

@todo: Fast Reload: I've removed it, but maybe it could work with a smaller buff plus a big debuff? ("light ammo"?)


## What's New

Includes all changes from [JYDGE Recalibrated](https://www.nexusmods.com/jydge/mods/2) (by Illamasqua). Be sure to read that mod's description to see what else has changed.

**New Stuff**

- New Weapon (1)
- New Cyberware (8)
- New Gavel Mods (9)
- New Specials (2)

**New Features**

- The level editor is now available from the main menu! âœ¨
- The Jydge has a new custom color scheme, inspired by Judge Dredd! (note: this might be moved to a standalone mod later)


### Costs

- Reduced costs of the last enhancement 2 slots:
  - Cyberware: 40k > 30k
  - Gavel: 30k > 20k
- Reduced costs of secondary weapons. Cost reductions are more drastic for early game unlocks, when players are likely to be saving for enhancement slots.
- Costs should now be low enough to buy a few new unlocks impacting your savings as much.


### Weapons

**New Weapon**

- Laser Shotgun!
  - This is the single cut weapon from the vanilla game files, now restored.
  - The game has a limit of 14 weapons, so 1 weapon had to be sacrificed. So I removed the Plasma Shotgun, as Plasma Burst does something similar already.
  - The unused vanilla version is pretty weak. This new version has an improved fire rate, damage, and projectile count. It keeps its very long range.
  - Unlocks after 30 medals.

**Balance & Tweaks**

- Lead Byllets + Shotgyn:
  - Now have 5 upgrade levels instead of 10.
  - *Aims to discourage wasting points with those weaker weapons.*
- Ion Rifle:
  - Raised medal requirement slightly (18 > 20).
  - *This makes it consistent with other requirements, as most weapons unlock after every 10 medals.*
- Ion Shotgun:
  - Now unlocked after 100 medals, instead of 70.
  - Base damage has been doubled (7 > 14).
  - Max targets: 2 > 4
  - *Ion weapons feel pretty weak in vanilla, especially with so few perks. But this massive buff should let the Ion Shotgun contend with other late-game weapons.*
- Plasma SMG (Rypid Plasma):
  - Increased damage: 12 > 16
  - Faster reload: 1.75 > 1.25
  - *Makes this flamethrower feel a lot more powerful.*
- Lead Sniper:
  - Increase damage: 100 > 140
  - *Lets you score one-shots more reliably, and makes this thing even more powerful with uprgades.*
- Tiny Ryckets (Rocket Launcher):
  - Increased damage: 20 > 25
  - *Rockets now deal slightly more damage on impact.*
- Charged Shot:
  - Faster max charge time: 2 > 1.5
  - *Recalibrated already buffed this weapon, but charging still felt too slow fot the last weapon unlock. Now it's even more deserving of that final slot.*


### Specials (Abilities)

**New Abilities**

- Cluster Grenades - unlocks at 23 medals
- Antioch Grenades - unlocks at 113 medals

**Balance & Tweaks**

- Slots:
  - Unlock cost for slot 3: 40,000 > 30,000
- Explosive Bolt:
  - Number of uses: 7 > 6.
  - Upgrading now increases the number of uses, insead of the damage.
  - *Explosive Bolts do roughly the same thing as the Grenade Launcher. This tweak makes them more unique, and gives you plenty of chances to miss your shots.*
- Overall Costs:
  - The cost to unlock every ability has been drastically reduced.
  - *This should make it easier and faster to try out unlocks as you acquire them.*


### Cyberware (Enhancements 1)

**New Cyberware**

| Name             | Effect |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Pyromaniac       | Immunity to fire damage. Fires you start have 4x burn time. |
| Vampire          | Drain HP from everything around you. |
| Faster Faster    | Time runs 2x faster, but you deal 1.5x damage. |

| Slowdown Field   | Enemies within the field walk slowly. Combos with Friend of Mine. |

**Balance & Tweaks**

- Bullet Dodger:
  - Now also makes you turn instantly (in addition to slowing enemy projectiles).
  - *This tweak gives you more dodge control.*
- Reaper:
  - Damage dealt to enemies with less than 50% HP is now increased by +20%, instead of being doubled.
  - *The vanilla version is just OP, effectively granting a global damage buff.*
- GIANT!:
  - Increased melee knockback: 250% > 300%.
  - *The text now shows the stats, which are now all +300%.*
- Rita the Rocket Drone (Companion):
  - Shot interval 1 > 0.3, but clip size 1 > 3
  - *Can she now shoot a volley of 3 rockets at once! And the reduced fire rate means she's less likely to kill you.*
- Sickness:
  - Removed completely (too OP).


### Gavel Mods (Ehnancements 2)

**New Gavel Mods**

| Name             | Effect |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Accurate         | You gain Perfect accuracy with most non-shotgun weapons. |
| Active Reload    | Increases manual reload speed by 25%. |
| Armory           | Clip size is increased x8, but the extra weight slows you down to half speed. |
| Big Boomer       | Grenades fuse times are halved, and their explosive radius is increased by 50%. |
| No Fuse          | Grenades explode instantly. |
| Splinter Bullets | Your projectiles will split in two shortly after leaving the barrel. |
| Neon Lasers      | Fire rate is increased by 10x, but LASER damage is decreased by 60%. Non-Laser projectiles do ZERO damage. |
| Flaming Plasma   | Increases PLASMA damage by 40%. Plasma shots set enemies on fire, which may cause them to flee. |
| Triple Bangers   | Grenades you deploy spawn three small submunitions. |

**Balance & Tweaks**

- Murderous Lead:
  - Now a late-game unlock, and only gives a +20% damage increase with lead shots.
- Power Gavel:
  - Now also gives +30% increase to melee speed.
- Melee Deflect:
  - Added 360 ability, and renamed to "360 Deflect".
- Fast Reload:
  - Removed completely (too OP).


### Text Changes

**Misc**

- Mission End: Changed "Weapon Mods" to "Gavel Mods", to match the phrase used elsewhere.
- Pause Screen: Added a reminder/tip below the Restart button telling you to hold it to change your loadout on restart.

**Collectibles**

- Hints Now specify the required difficulty.
- Sin Eraser: Changed "Reset Sins" button text to say "View Reset Options".
- Sin Eraser: Expanded description to say "and optionally reset your mission progress (NG+)".
- C.A.T.S.: Hint expanded to say "who holds the key?".
- Time Recoil Comic: Added "by 25%" (note: this collectiable also increases move speed by 20%).

**Enhancement Descriptions**

- Health is now shown with a heart icon (in vanilla this is inconsistent).
- Credits are now shown with an icon.
- Green text highlights altered slightly to better show effects.
- Red text highlights have been added to show negative effects.
- Fast Melee: Expanded description to mention melee attack charge speed.
- GIANT!: Expanded description to specify stat change, and added hidden melee knockback stat.
- Damage Credits: Revised description to be clearer.

### Colour Changes

Most icons have new colours, and are grouped by theme/build. This should make it easier to set up a loadout with items that synergise well with each other.

- Gavel Mods for melee are now purple.
- Cyberware that affects health are now red.
- Cyberware that affects credits are now yellow.

### GFX (Graphics)

It's now easier to see where you're shooting, and what you're dodging.

- Projectile size halved, for ion & enemy bullets. Their vanilla size makes their hitboxes look larger than they really are.
- Rocket trails have much less smoke. Tiny Ryckets have less sparks too. It's now easier to see where rockets are, as the screen is less obscured by smoke.

### Audio

- Added custom hurt sounds for the player character (pitch-shifted human male wi. some EQ). Now you can tell when you're being hit!
- Reduced the volume of the Shadow Cloak sound, down to 25%.

### Misc

- Added missing monospace font needed for the editor. This is taken from Dysmantle, so it's not perfect.

### Bugs

- Circle bug wi. slow field + vamp ring:
  - There's an issue with the AoE rings for both Vampire & Slowdown field.
  - Explosions & fire that overlap the rings will affect the player, even though they're outside of the player's hitbox.
  - However, there's an unexpected bonus to this: You can combo Friend of Mine with Slowdown field to convert mines from a long distance.
